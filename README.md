# CalendarProject
### Description:
Simple side project I did to help with the process of choosing a schedule at UIUC.

### How it was done
I created a python scraper to get the course information from https://courses.illinois.edu/cisapp/explorer/schedule <br/>
Courses were then saved into firebase.<br/>
The calendar application is in java, using javafx. 

### Useful Functionality:
* Ability to add all sections of a course to the calendar and then pick which section to keep.
* Filter sections in a course to only those within a specific time frame
* Find sections that do not conflict with current courses
